# Nested Navigation Tutorial

Nested Navigation is one of the most important concept on Flutter.
In this project I use [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) package to handle it. GoRouter is a Flutter favorite package that is useful to handling navigation of an app.

I use some classes to handle state like [StatefulShellRoute](https://pub.dev/documentation/go_router/latest/go_router/StatefulShellRoute-class.html),  [StatefulShellBranch](https://pub.dev/documentation/go_router/latest/go_router/StatefulShellBranch-class.html) and [StatefulNavigationShell](https://pub.dev/documentation/go_router/latest/go_router/StatefulNavigationShell-class.html).
